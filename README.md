# ToDoList ![Justto 3DR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guiriosoficial/ToDoList-Justto/refs/heads/master/public/justto-logo.svg)
This project was my challenge for an internship job at Justto, my first application on Vue.js.

## The Challenge
The challenge is to create a **TODO List** that meets the following requirements:
- Be able to insert, edit and remove tasks from the list,
- Be developed in Vue.js with Webpack and be an SPA,
- Have an "About" page using vue-router (Bonus)

## Project Setup

```
- **Compiles For Production:**
```shell

- **Check and Fix Lint**

```

## Update
To maintain this project update, I migrated from Vue 2 to Vue 3, Webpack to Vite and JavaScript to TypeScript
